> "I specialize in teaching sand how to think." (and occasionally, how to match resumes and predict diabetes).

Welcome to the central node of my digital footprint. This is a highly optimized, minimalist portfolio architected entirely from the ground up using React, Framer Motion, and Three.js (WebGL). It serves as the primary gateway to my machine learning research, agentic ecosystem pipelines, and competitive programming statistics.

## 🚀 The Stack
- **Framework:** React + Vite (because waiting for Webpack to compile is a cardinal sin).
- **Styling:** Vanilla CSS (no Tailwind utility-class explosions here, pure CSS mathematical precision).
- **Physics Engine:** React Three Fiber / Drei (rendering an infinite 6,000-particle parallax starfield).
- **Motion:** Framer Motion (for fluid, cinematic page transitions).

## 🔗 Live Deployment

Deploying this beast? It's Vercel-ready right out of the box. 

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/SubashSK777/Portfolio.git

# Enter the void
